I built an end-to-end Olist analysis notebook that:

Loaded the dataset files from the main folder.
Cleaned and combined the order, item, payment, review, customer, product, and category data into one analytic table called master.
Created derived business metrics such as:
- total order value
- approval, carrier, and delivery durations
- delivery delay gap vs. estimated delivery date
- review score summaries

Generated a set of charts and export files for reporting.
What each visual shows:

- Revenue by product category: highlights which product categories contribute the most revenue.
- Order status and payment mix: shows the share of orders by status and the mix of payment methods used.
- Delivery time distributions: helps identify how long orders spend in approval, transit, and final delivery stages.
- Review score summary: shows customer satisfaction distribution and whether reviews skew positive or negative.
- Top products by revenue: identifies the highest revenue-generating products.

How these visuals can be used:

- Business decision support: prioritize categories, products, or payment methods that drive performance.
- Operations monitoring: spot bottlenecks in delivery timing or order processing.
- Customer experience analysis: understand review patterns and service issues.
- Reporting and dashboards: export the results as CSV files for stakeholders or BI tools.

In short, the notebook turns raw transaction data into a simple business dashboard that can help answer questions like:

- What drives revenue?
- Where are delivery delays happening?
- Which payment methods are most common?
- How are customers rating the service?
